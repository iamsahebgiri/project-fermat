Instead they\nproceed directly to jail.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a\nplayer lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective\npile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom\nof the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of\nthis problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any\ninstruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player\nwill remain on the CC/CH square.\n\n  * Community Chest (2/16 cards):\n\n      1.

That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll.\nFor this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for\nwhich the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have\nthe lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and\nit is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we\nare interested in.
